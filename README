Exotic Cars Dealership: 2026 Collection
===============================================================   
Welcome to my Exotic Cars Dealership app! This is a digital showroom I built using Python and Streamlit. 
The idea came from my passion for luxury cars and my desire to create an interactive experience that mimics visiting a high-end dealership.
I wanted to create a smooth, high-end experience where a user could register, browse luxury cars, 
and simulate a secure checkout process all in one place.

How the App Works (The User Journey)
I designed this app to feel like a real-life dealership visit, split into three simple steps:

The Welcome Desk (Registration): The app greets you and asks for your name. 
I added logic here to make sure the app "cleans" your input removing accidental spaces and making it uppercase
so the greeting looks perfect.

The showroom (Browsing): Once inside, you meet "Angel," the virtual assistant. 
You can choose from a curated list of 2026 models (Porsches, Audis, and Mercedes).
I used a split-screen layout here: one side shows the professional photography of the car, and the other shows the specs and pricing.

The VIP Office (Secure Payment): When you're ready to buy, the app moves to a checkout screen.
You can choose to pay online (with a hidden card input for security) or get instructions for an in-person visit.

The "Brain" Behind the App (Technical Highlights)
If you are looking at my code, here are a few things I'm proud of:

App Memory (Session State): Streamlit apps usually "forget" everything if you click a button.
I implemented session_state so the app remembers your name and your chosen car as you move between screens.

Dynamic UI: The app isn't just a static page. The images and prices change instantly based on your selection in the dropdown menu.

Security Simulation: In the payment section, I used type="password" for the card input. Even though this is a demo,
I wanted to show that I prioritize user privacy.

Visual Polish: I added a "spinner" to simulate real-time processing and "balloons" to celebrate a successful purchase,
 making the app feel professional and fun.
